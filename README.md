# Fire-Detection-Using-CNN
 Fire detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a popular and effective approach for automatically identifying and detecting fires in images or videos. CNNs are well-suited for this task as they can automatically learn relevant features from the visual data, enabling them to distinguish between fire and non-fire regions.
